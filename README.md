# Data2Vis-PyTorch README

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of the Data2Vis model, based on the original research paper. The notebook is designed to reproduce the results presented in the paper, demonstrating how machine learning can be used to automatically generate visualizations from data. The code was able to reproduce the same loss achieved in the original paper and produced similar visualizations.
